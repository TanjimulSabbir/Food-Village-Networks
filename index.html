                    <h3>Chicken Cutlets with Sun-Dried Tomato Cream Sauce</h3>


                    <p>Though a chicken cutlet may be a chicken breast cut in half, this recipe shows how to make
                        chicken
                        cutlets with double the deliciousness. A jar of sun-dried tomatoes does double duty for this
                        healthy
                        dinner recipe. The flavorful oil they're packed in is used to sauté the chicken, and the
                        tomatoes go
                        into the cream sauce.</p>

                        crust! It's filled with sweet wild mushrooms and savory Gruyère cheese. Enjoy it for
